You will generate a concise, entity-dense summary of the above Article. Follow these steps:
1. Identify 1-3 informative Entities (";" delimited) that are missing from the previous summary.
2. Write a new, denser summary that covers every entity and detail from the previous summary.

A Missing Entity is:
- Relevant: to the main story.
- Specific: descriptive yet concise (5 words or fewer).
- Novel: not in the previous summary.
- Faithful: present in the Article.
- Anywhere: located anywhere in the Article.

Guidelines:
- If this is the first summary, it should be long (4-5 sentences, ~80 words) yet highly non-specific, containing little information beyond the entities marked as missing. Use overly verbose language and fillers (e.g., "this article discusses") to reach ~80 words.
- For subsequent summaries, make every word count: rewrite the previous summary to improve flow and make space for additional entities.
- Make space with fusion, compression, and removal of uninformative phrases like "the article discusses".
- The summary should be concise yet self-contained, e.g., easily understood without the Article.
- Never drop entities from the previous summary. If space cannot be made, add fewer new entities.".
