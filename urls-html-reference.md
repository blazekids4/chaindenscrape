  <h3><strong>Program updates, including new designations and certifications for partners</strong></h3>
  <p><span data-contrast="none">Solutions partner designations and specializations are one way we help partners differentiate themselves in the market. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Designations and certifications help to verify skills and validate the effectiveness of solutions so customers can find the partner and technology that’s right for their needs.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p><span data-contrast="none">To obtain designations and specializations, partners must meet skilling and performance requirements, and provide customer evidence to demonstrate their capabilities — and partners have embraced this opportunity with Microsoft AI. We have seen 58 percent growth since last July in partner designations for Azure Data and AI solutions, and 172 percent growth in partner specializations for the Build and Modernize AI apps with Azure and AI and Machine Learning designations.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p><span data-contrast="auto">To build on this momentum, today we are announcing several new designations for partners across software, services and training.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p><b><span data-contrast="auto">A new set of designations for partners who develop software: Solutions Partner with certified software</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p><span data-contrast="auto">Today, we are pleased to announce the general availability of Solutions Partner[i]</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;with certified software[ii]</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;designations. Certified software designations provide an opportunity to better connect with customers and to unlock additional benefits from Microsoft.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p><span data-contrast="auto">By becoming a Solutions Partner with certified software, partners can differentiate their solution, increase their discoverability in the Microsoft Commercial Marketplace, connect with more customers, and take advantage of marketing and branding resources designed to help accelerate revenue growth in a rapidly expanding market.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p><span data-contrast="auto">There are two pathways to become a Solutions Partner with certified software: </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">solution areas</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> and </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">Industry AI</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">:&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>

  </ul>
  <p><span data-contrast="none">More than 75 partners with solutions across all five industries and from around the world have participated in the public preview of the designation, including Netherlands, Iceland, Germany, United Kingdom, France, Norway, Ireland, India, Canada and the United States. There are 49 solutions currently certified with an additional 27 in progress.</span></p>
  <p><b><span data-contrast="auto">New Training Services Solutions Partner designations</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p><span data-contrast="auto">We are also releasing new designations for partners who provide training services. Starting April 10, partners who qualify for Solutions Partner for Training Services designations will be able to complete enrollment.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p><span data-contrast="auto">Qualified partners will receive designation-specific badges distinguishing their services from other partner types within the Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program.

  <p><span data-contrast="auto">Based on partner feedback, we are investing in our small- and mid-sized business ecosystem and creating a pathway for partners who focus on delivering solutions for SMB customers across Azure Data &amp; AI, Digital &amp; App Innovation, Infrastructure and Security.&nbsp; Later this year, we will introduce dedicated SMB paths for Solutions Partner designations for Azure​ and Security, adding to our existing SMB paths for Business Applications and Modern Work.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p><span data-contrast="auto">For partners who serve smaller businesses, this creates an exciting new opportunity — a new way to qualify for existing Solutions Partner designations, giving more partners access to the products, go-to-market resources, support, and advisory benefits that come with these designations. The new SMB paths will differentiate partners who can meet customer needs and drive customer success by validating those partners’ capabilities in our Azure and Security solution areas.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
